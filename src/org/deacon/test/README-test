DEACON - A Java Push Notification Library for Android (and beyond) 

=== WHAT'S HERE ===

DeaconServiceTest.java .... JUnit test class that exercises DeaconService 
							class and some others

=== HOW TO TEST ===

The JUnit Test Cases in this package can be run in a pure Java environment; an 
Android environment is not necessary.

As a consequence, only the pure Java portions of Deacon are tested by these 
tests. The Android wrapper portions are tested using the Android testing tools 
provided in the Android SDK. These tests are [will be] implemented in a 
separate test project that runs against the Deacon Demo application.
