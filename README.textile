An open-source push notifications library for Android and Java applications.

h1. Background

The Deacon Project aims to produce an open-source push notifications library for the Android platform. "Deacon" is a Java class library used by Android developers to receive Push notifications from a Meteor comet web server. "Deacon-Demo" (http://github.com/davidrea/Deacon-Demo/) is an Android app that is used for testing and demonstration of Deacon, and is also developed by members of the Deacon project.

h1. Getting Started

To develop or test Deacon in Eclipse:

# Create a new Eclipse project and add the Deacon source files to it
# Install the Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
# Run the Android executable (in the tools/ directory) to install an Android platform (preferably the latest, 2.1)
# Right click on the Deacon Eclipse project and configure the build path
# Click "Add External Jar..." and select the android.jar file from the appropriate Android platform directory
# Click the "Add Library..." and add a JUnit library to the project.
# Ensure the JUnit library has higher precedence than the android.jar file.

h1. Meteor Server

In order to run a Deacon application, you'll need a Meteor push server. Meteor can be set up on your local Linux or Windows box using the instructions on the "Server Setup wiki page":https://github.com/davidrea/Deacon/wiki/Server-setup.

The Project also operates a test server with several automatic channels. Details about the Deacon test server can be found in the "Deacon Alpha Release blog entry":http://deacon.daverea.com/2010/05/deacon-alpha-released/.
