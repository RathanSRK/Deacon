The diagrams in this directory are created using the Umlet UML editor:
http://www.umlet.com/

After a diagram is updated, its raster image in the img/ directory must also be updated. This is done manually.
The raster image is referenced by Deacon wiki pages, so the image must be exported before changes will appear in the Deacon wiki.
The wiki automatically tracks the latest version of the image in the 'master' branch.
