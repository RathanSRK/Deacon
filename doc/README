The diagrams in this directory are created using the UML2 Tools from Eclipse:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-UML2Tools

After a diagram is updated, its raster image in the img/ directory must also be updated. This is done manually.
The raster image is referenced by Deacon wiki pages, so the image must be exported before changes will appear in the Deacon wiki.
The wiki automatically tracks the latest version of the image in the 'master' branch.

To export the image, right-click anywhere on the diagram and select File-->Save As Image File...
Then be sure the path includes img/ and the file name is the same as the existing file.
The image will appear as updated in the wiki on your next pushed commit.
